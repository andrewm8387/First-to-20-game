# First-to-20-game
A C implementation of the 'first to 20 game' using value iteration to solve the optimal play style.

While there is an optimal soltuion to the game. This implementation shows that value iteration finds the same optimal policy.

## Game Rules
Starting from 0 players may add either 1 or 2 to the total. If the total is 20 then they win.
